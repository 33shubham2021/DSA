"""
Path problems in a maze, this in itself is a huge topic, combining graphs (DFS, BFS), DP and backtracking

eg, count the number of ways, becomes DP problem

INDEX (Scaler) - 
1.a given a maze, find if a path exists from start to end of the maze
1.b given a maze, find if a path exists from any cell to any other target cell in the maze

2.a print/get all permutation of a char/int array 
2.b print permutations in lexicographically sorted order

3.a print/get all unique permutations of a given char/int array
3.b do the above in sorted order

4.a
